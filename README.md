## 🧩 Abstract
The study introduces a **hybrid Bayesian–Kalman forecasting model** combined with a **PI-controlled buck–boost converter** for effective SOC equalization in lithium-ion battery packs.  
The proposed approach minimizes SOC imbalance, enhances charge utilization efficiency, and provides predictive control against dynamic load variations.  
Simulation results demonstrate improved accuracy and faster convergence compared to traditional PI-based methods.
